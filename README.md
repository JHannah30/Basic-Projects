# Various-Projects

During the School of Code part-time bootcamp, I made many projects to learn and practice programming concepts and technologies. Most of them were built in vanilla JS and as the bootcamp progresses so quickly, weren't finished to the standard that I would've liked. I decided to create this repository as a single location for these projects to live, however I'm going to be refactoring them using React.

I'll be working on refactoring one project at a time and will be adding more as they are completed.


## Projects in this Repository (so far)

* Higher or Lower
* Rock, Paper, Scissors



## Higher or Lower

We're all familiar with this game - it's a golden oldie! 


### The Rules

Simply guess if the upcoming number is higher or lower than the number currently being displayed. If you guessed incorrectly, you lose. If you guessed correctly, you don't lose (for now). If the number is the same, you get to guess again. 

Normally, you'd be playing for some sort of money but unfortunately, I'm still working on the next big cryptocurrency and it's a way off, so that'll have to wait. In the meantime, beating your high score will have to do.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

Another game for the all-time list of golden oldies, but with a twist! Just kidding, there's no twist. I don't have the audacity to ruin a classic.


### The Rules
Choose an action - Rock, Paper or Scissors. Each action is strong and weak against another action. The objective is to choose an action that is strong against your opponents action. Do that for enough rounds and you've won! If you guess the same action as your opponent, it's  draw. Remember:

* Rock > Scissors
* Scissors > Paper
* Paper > Rock
