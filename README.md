# Basic-Projects

During the School of Code part-time bootcamp, we made many projects to learn and practice programming concepts and technologies. Most of them were built in vanilla JS and as the bootcamp progresses so quickly, weren't finished to the standard that I would've liked. I decided to create this repository as a single location for these projects to live, however I'm going to be refactoring them using React.
